# Freecode-camp File Metadata Microservice

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

1. User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

2. User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
